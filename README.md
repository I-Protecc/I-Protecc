# Hi, I'm coco, 
also known as I-Protecc.

I'm a student from Germany, looking to get better at coding for my own interest and for future employment opportunities.
I am currently learning Java and C#, and plan to expand my repertoire with Js, and possibly Python or Lua.

If there's any interest in working together or any questions, feel free to ask :D
